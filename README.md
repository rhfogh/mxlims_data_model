# MXLIMS data model

The current version is 0.6.10

The MXLIMS data model is a collaborative data model to serve for both API specification and
potentially as the basis for data storage solutions, for macromolecular crystallography and
related scientific areas. The model is implemented as JSON schemas, with pydantic
classes and html documentation generated therefrom.

For general documentation see docs/Overview.pdf

For  an account of the modeling and use of X-ray centring, see docs/XrayCentring.pdf

docs/examples contain example JSON files (not necessarily from the very latest version)
and mapping files, showing the mapping between MXLIMS and other formats.

For a detailed snapshot of the MXLIMS model as of early 2025 see MXLIMS_presentation_2025.pdf

For model documentation see docs/html, where docs/html/MxlimsMessage.html is the starting point,
for covering the entire model.

## Installation

There is no need for particular installation.
To make use of MXLIMS you simply download and use the JSON schemas.
Html documentation and a Pydantic Python implementation are autogenerated from the 
JSON schemas and can be downloaded as well, or regenerated in place.


## JSON schemas

The JSON schemas in mxlims/schemas are the authoritative version of the data model.
They are organised as follows:

  - schemas/core contain the abstract classes that define the links and foreign keys
  that are used to represent the model in a (MongoDB-type) database.

  - schemas/datatypes contain all datatypes, i.e. schemas for data that do not have an
  object ID, compare by value, and that can be used in any context. Examples are the
  definitions of enumerations (e.g. space group names), or unit cells.

  - schemas/data contain the definitions of all fields for each supported object,
  those that would be represented as metadata in an ICAT-type database.
  These can be used with the GeneralMessage.json to represent any combination of objects,
  but they lack 1) the faculty for hierarchically nesting objects, 2) the constraints
  on which types of objects can be linked, the links being defined only by untyped foreign keys.

  - schemas/objects contain the complete objects, inheriting the data fields (from schemas/data) .
  and the core objects (from schemas/core) and adding type specifications for the inter-object links
  that are allowed for the particular object (e.g. Pucks cna contain Pins, but not vice versa).

  - schemas/references contain schemas that define references to particular object types.
  These are used both as part of the specification and for JSON messages; their contents
  is derived from the definitions in schemas/data, using the mxlims/impl/generate_code.py script.
  Note that while the reference are used as-is in specifying JSON documents, they are *not*
  translated directly to the AP implementations. These use instead the direct storage of target
  uuids, with field names like 'sourceId' or 'inputDataIds', and with derived field names
  like 'source', 'logisticalSamples', or 'inputData' to access the linked-to objects.
  More detail can be found in the Overview.pdf document.

## JSON html documentation

docs/html contains linked html files for all JSON objects and datatypes in the model.

The documentation is generated using the program https://coveooss.github.io/json-schema-for-humans/#/
with the command (starting in the mxlims_data_model directory)

generate-schema-doc --config-file docs/schemadoc_config.json schemas docs/html

To cover the entire model starting from the top containers you should begin with the file 
doc/html/MxlimsMessage.html as this message can incorporate any object in the model.

There are examples of mxlims messages in docs/examples

## Pydantic

The pydantic files live in mxlims/pydantic; they are generated from the JSON schemas in part using
https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/integrations/datamodel_code_generator/

The generated Pydantic for data and datatypes is correct, but the complete API requires also
a manually coded im[plementation class, and code generation procedures for pydantic/objects.

## Prototype implementation

There is a prototype Python implementation, generated using the mxlims/impl/generate_code.py script.
There is also a test MXCuBE integration. See the relevant mxcubecore WIP pull requests for details.

## Data conversion

For getting the full benefit of the MXLIMS model and standardisation
you should connect your applications and LIMS to MXLIMS using the API.
As a preliminary measure there is an application for converting between
simple spreadheet (one-line-per-experiment) formats amd MXLIMS, using
a single mapping file. For a working implementation see mxlims/conversion/
