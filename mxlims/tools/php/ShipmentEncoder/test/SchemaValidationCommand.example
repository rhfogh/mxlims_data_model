Create a file in this directory called SchemaValidationCommand. This should
contain only the command to validate a JSON file against a schema on your
system. The following line is how I (Ed Daniel) do it in PowerShell.

"C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe" -command  Test-Json -SchemaFile {{$schemaFile}} -Path {{$jsonFile}}
